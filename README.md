# Calvin and Hobbes Memory Game

![Calvin-and-Hobbes](https://i.imgur.com/3CnDQDL.png)

This is a simple first react.js application, focused on learning the basics of React.js components, state, and user generated responses. The general structure of the app was created using `Create React App`, which is pretty much the bee's knees. 

No other packages were used in development, but gh-pages was used for deployment. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Play

It's really easy! 12 random images are displayed on the page. When the user clicks on an image, all 12 are shuffled in to a new random order on the page. The goal is click on all 12 images, WITHOUT clicking on a duplicate. You win if you get a score of 12, if not, try try again. Bonus point if you understand the game over prompt.

### App Challenges

Overall the application development went pretty smooth. I was able to pull a good amount of information from class exercises, and the application javascript was not too involved. However, I did run into some deployment problems, specifically permission issues related to branching and initial deploy on gh-pages. I believe these issues stemmed from my initial app creation, coupled with how I created and cloned my github repo. To fix this, I simply created a new app and repo, copied over my bulk code, and started the process again. I opted to keep this repo as primary, as it tracks my actual work.
